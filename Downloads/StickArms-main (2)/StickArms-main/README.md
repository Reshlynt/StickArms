Stick Race is a two dimensional rogue-like “shoot ‘em up” video game similar to Vampire Survivors (Poncle, ltd. 2022). A player controls a character that begins the game with a single attack, as well as the enemy.  Players survive “waves” of enemies by eliminating each attacker of a wave without being defeated themselves. Survive as long as you can
