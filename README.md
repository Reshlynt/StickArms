Stick Race is a two dimensional rogue-like “shoot ‘em up” video game similar to Vampire Survivors (Poncle, ltd. 2022). A player controls a character that begins the game with a single attack, as well as the enemy.  Players survive “waves” of enemies by eliminating each attacker of a wave without being defeated themselves. Surviving a wave allows a player to acquire upgrades to improve their character, but each upgrade that the player takes on themselves improves the enemies as well. A player then must be able to balance between acquiring upgrades that are beneficial to them while being able to overcome the enemy as long as they can.
